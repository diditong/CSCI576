Just run the following shell command to see output images:
Image.exe <path-to-image> number
where "number" is the number of coefficients.

The image on left side is the image compressed using DCT, and the image on the right is the image compressed using DWT. Note that the DCT compression takes about 5 - 10 seconds, so please wait for a while before you can see the output images.
